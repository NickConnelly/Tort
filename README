LEARNGGS Installation Manual
============================
Igor Chubin, 2013-2014


== Installation ==

This manual describes how the LEARNGGS software can be install on a Linux system.

Actual copy of the manual you can find here:

* http://igor.chub.in/projects/learnggs/INSTALL.html

[NOTE]
===============================
The manual describes installation on the Debian GNU/Linux system.

Other Debian-based distributions can be used as well, but the names of the OS-based
dependencies may differ. Please check these names if you want to install the software
on non-Debian system.

Non-Debian distributions can also be used, but the step "Installation of OS Level dependencies"
must be done according to the rules of the distibution where the software to be installed.
All other steps stay the same.
===============================


=== Download and unpack the source code ===

    cd
    wget http://igor.chub.in/projects/learnggs/learnggs-20140211.tar.gz
    tar xf learnggs-20140211.tar.gz -C /opt
    cd /opt/learnggs-20140211

You can install the software in any directory. Here we use +/opt+ to install.
The software will be installed to +/opt/learnggs-20140211+.

Please note, that you need root rights to install the software in +/opt+.

=== Installation of OS Level dependencies ===

[NOTE]
================================
Installation of OS-Level dependencies need
root privileges. You must be +root+ or use +sudo+ to do this step.
================================

The way how the dependencies should be installed depends on
the OS type where the software will be installed/used.

For Debian GNU/Linux (and Debian-based Linux distributions also, but please note,
that the names of the packages may differ):

    sudo apt-get install ` < requiremetns-os.txt `

Dependencies:

    * python-dev
    * python-pip
    * python-virtualenv
    * python-stemmer
    * poppler-utils
    * sdcv
    * lynx
    * catdoc
    * screen


In other distributions you must install all these packages 
using the way that is supposed to be used in the distribution.

=== Installation of Python dependencies ===

When you are inside the root of the project (please change to it first, use "cd" for that),
you must issue these commands to install all Python-level dependencies:
    
    cd /opt/learnggs-20140211
    virtualenv ve
    ve/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

After the installation of the dependencies successfully completed,
you may go to the next step.

== Configuring ==

    cd /opt/learnggs-20140211
    mkdir -p myproject/database/
    ve/bin/python manage.py syncdb
    ve/bin/python manage.py check_permissions

You will get several questions.
You must answer these questions.

The installation is now completed.
Now you can start the program.

=== Email configuration ===

In order to use user self-registering functionality,
you need to configure email-server in +settings.py+:

    EMAIL_USE_TLS = True  
    EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.mail.ru'
    EMAIL_PORT = 587  
    EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'username@mail.ru'
    EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'password here'
    DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'admin@learnggs.com'

Also, please note, that you need to configure your site
in the admin section of the server and specify realname of your site
instead of +example.com+.

== Running ==

=== First start ===

To start the program in the debug/development mode:

    ve/bin/python manage.py runserver

Or, if you want that the program be accessible
from other machines in the net:

    ve/bin/python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

The program is now accessible at

    http://address.of.your.machine:8000/

Please note that the program will be stopped if you close the window
where it runs.

If you want that the program runs even after that, please start +screen+ before
it:

    screen -S learnggs 

And then, when you are inside the +screen+ session you can start the program:

    ve/bin/python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000

=== Production running ===

To run the program in the production mode, you need to use external webserver
like Apache/nginx and configure it to communicate with the program by means of WSGI interface.

Please refer to the documentation of your webserver or contact me if you need help.

== Example ==

This example session shows the installation process conducted on a fresh Debian GNU/Linux host.
