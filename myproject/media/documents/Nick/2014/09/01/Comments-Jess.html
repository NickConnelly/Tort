<P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">Profile:</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">When using the button profile it says
“page not found”.</P>
<P><BR><BR>
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">Lists:</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">When I used the “Lists” button in
the first place there were none. As soon as I uploaded a document in
English there was the “Basic English Vocabulary” list. Do lists
only pop up, when uploading a file in that language?</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">Wanting to take a look at the “Basic
English Vocabulary” nothing happened.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">Why is that list marked yellow? Does
every language have another color?</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">When I wanted to “Update” the
wordlist it didn't let me. It brought me back to the “Lists”
page.</P>
<P>Creating a new list is easy. Adding words to a wordlist is also
intuitive but it seems to be a lot of work. 
</P>
<P>What does “Blind merge to” mean? It is not applicable that
wordlists will be merged. Only when the notice pops up one
understands that.</P>
<P>What does “attended merge to” mean?</P>
<P>I choose to select a wordlist and merge (and keep) it to that same
wordlist. Tortoise noted that it merged 1 wordlist. That doesn't make
any sense to me.</P>
<P>Next I chose to merge (and delete) a wordlist to that same
wordlist. The wordlist got deleted. It would be nice if there was a
notice/an alert whether one was sure whether they wanted to delete
something.</P>

<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">Upload:</P>
<P>Uploading a small document takes a few minutes.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">Assets:</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">Words:</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">Word classifications are
understandable. In addition it could be useful to add a color to each
classification, such as blue for verbs, green for nouns, etc. 
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">For some words there are Russian
descriptions next to the word classification,which is confusing.</P>
<P>“<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">the” is classified as an
article and as an adverb although I don't think it can be an adverb.</SPAN></P>
<P><SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">I used play as a verb. Tortoise
showed that play can be a verb or a noun. It divides into the words
play and playing that I used. I think it would make sense to narrow
it down to only “verb” for clearly conjugated verbs such as
playing in this case, if possible.</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">Using the drop down option for
individual words:</P>
<P>“<SPAN STYLE="font-weight: normal">Nothing similar to..”
means? Nothing similar in this text? When using the drop down option
there is never anything similar to the word with the classification
next to it. How come? Does it still make sense to have the drop down
option there?</SPAN></P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">When using the drop down option for an
individual word, it is nice that that particular word is marked bold.
It is only marked bold when it appears first in the document though.
I think it would be nice to have it marked bold every single time it
is detected in the document.</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">When using the drop down option next
to the words there is the option to “show more”. Whenever it is
pressed something happens in the back end but not in the front end.
What is there more that can be shown? Links to other documents?</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">It's nice that there is a link to the
Upload section. 
</P>
<P STYLE="font-weight: normal">The words are always shown as their
'stem/basic form' and in the way they appear in the text. If there is
only one way of spelling a word that becomes redundant,. This applies
to words like the, to, me, etc. Therefore those words would only need
to appear once in the list with their frequency and classification.
Unless that poses a problem regarding the 'drop down option'.</P>
